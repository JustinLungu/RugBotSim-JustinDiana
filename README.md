# RugBot

Swarm of miniature robots. Simulated version of RugBot in WeBots.

## Overview

This repository simulates the RugBot robot used for surface inspection tasks at the Distributed Robotic Systems Lab, Groningen. It is part of the ENTEG institute, specifically the DTPA department.

### Distributed Robotic Systems Lab, Groningen

The Distributed Robotic Systems Lab at Groningen focuses on developing advanced robotic systems for distributed tasks. 

## Repository Details

The `main` branch is dedicated to developing core functionalities for the RugBot simulation, including output-related tasks for the Webots robotic simulator (such as setting up environments).

### Branches

- Each branch focuses on specific algorithm development.
- The `main` branch serves as the base for merging updates to basic functionalities.

## Installation


### Installing Webots 2023b

1. **Download Webots:**
   - Visit the Webots download page: [Webots Download](https://cyberbotics.com/download).
   - Download the Webots 2023b for Ubuntu Linux as a `.tar.bz2` archive.

2. **Extract Webots:**
   - Open a terminal.
   - Navigate to the directory where the downloaded `.tar.bz2` file is located.
   - Use the following command to extract:

     ```bash
     tar -xvjf webots-2023b-rev1-x86-64.tar.bz2
     ```

   Replace `webots-2023b-rev1-x86-64.tar.bz2` with the actual filename.

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Check for any missing dependencies as per Webots documentation or runtime error messages.

4. **Launch Webots:**
   - Navigate to the extracted directory.
   - Start Webots using:

     ```bash
     ./webots
     ```

### Setting Up GitHub Desktop

1. **Download GitHub Desktop:**
   - Visit the GitHub Desktop website: [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
   - Download the `.deb` package for Ubuntu.

2. **Install GitHub Desktop:**
   - Open a terminal.
   - Navigate to the directory where the downloaded `.deb` file is located.
   - Install GitHub Desktop using:

     ```bash
     sudo dpkg -i github-desktop-*.deb
     ```

   Replace `github-desktop-*.deb` with the actual filename.

3. **Launch GitHub Desktop:**
   - Open GitHub Desktop from the Applications menu or by typing `github-desktop` in the terminal.
