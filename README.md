# RugBot

Swarm of miniature robots. Simulated version of RugBot in WeBots.

## Overview

This repository simulates the RugBot robot used for surface inspection tasks at the Distributed Robotic Systems Lab, Groningen. It is part of the ENTEG institute, within the DTPA department, led by PI Bahar Haghighat and supervised by PhD student Thiemen Siemensma.

### Distributed Robotic Systems Lab, Groningen

The Distributed Robotic Systems Lab at Groningen focuses on developing advanced robotic systems for distributed tasks. Led by PI Bahar Haghighat, the lab explores innovative approaches in robotic simulation and control, with applications in various fields including autonomous inspection and robotic swarm coordination.

## Repository Details

The `main` branch is dedicated to developing core functionalities for the RugBot simulation, including output-related tasks for the Webots robotic simulator (such as setting up environments).

### Branches

- Each branch focuses on specific algorithm development.
- The `main` branch serves as the base for merging updates to basic functionalities.

## Installation

Instructions for setting up and running the simulation will be provided here.

## Usage

Details on how to use and interact with the simulation will be included in this section.
